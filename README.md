# Advanced Calculator

This static client-side calculator supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and decimal numbers. It features a clear button to reset the calculator, a display area for current input and results, and buttons for digits 0-9, decimal point, and operators. The app is styled with a clean, simple layout and includes basic error handling for division by zero and invalid expressions. All logic is embedded within the HTML in a `<script>` tag, ensuring it runs fully on the client side.
